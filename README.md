# Final-Demoblaze-Project

   .Demoblaze website online shopping is a process where customers
        directly buy good services from a seller without an intermediary service
        over the Internet. Shoppers can visit web stores from the comfort of
        their houses and shop by sitting in front of a computer or in front of
        using hardware and software devices. It involves purchasing products
        over the Internet. Demoblaze Online shopping is done through an online
        shop, e-shop, e-store, virtual store, Internet shop, or online store. All the
        products in online stores are described through text, photos, and
        multimedia files. They often make available, safety procedures,
        instructions, manufacturing specifications, and demonstrations.
